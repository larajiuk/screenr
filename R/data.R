#' UIV Testing Data on Unicorns
#'
#' A preliminary study was conducted in which a random sample of 5,000 properly
#' consented unicorns were asked five questions about their behavior and health,
#' and they responded by stomping a hoof once to indicate "no" and twice to
#' indicate "yes".  A sample of blood was drawn from each, and was subsequently
#' tested for the presence of antibodies to Unicorn Immunodeficiency Virus (UIV).

#' repectively.
