\description{
A preliminary study was conducted in which a random sample of 5,000 properly
consented unicorns were each asked five questions about their behavior and
health. They responded by stomping a hoof once to indicate "no", and twice to
indicate "yes".  A sample of blood was drawn from each, and was subsequently
tested for the presence of antibodies to Unicorn Immunodeficiency Virus (UIV)
using a standard assay algorithm.
