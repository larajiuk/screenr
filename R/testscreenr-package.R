#' The \code{testscreenr} package enables construction of binary test screening
#' tool.  Consider the situation where a diagnostic test for some condition is
#' expensive, and the condition is rare.  In that case, universal testing
#' would not be efficient.  Now suppose that responses to a set of simple
#' questions may be predictive of the condition.  Package \code{code} enables
#' construction of tools to screen out individuals who are unlikely to express
#' the condition based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) estimated
#' from an initial sample.
