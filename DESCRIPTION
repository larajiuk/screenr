Description: The screenr package enables construction of binary test-screening
tools.  Consider the situation where a diagnostic test for some condition is
expensive, and the condition is rare.  In that case, universal testing
would not be efficient in terms of the yield of postive results per test
performed.  Now suppose that responses to a set of simple questions may be
predictive of the condition.  screenr enables the estimation of thresholds
for making decisions about when to test in order to screen in/out individuals
based on Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) estimated from an initial
sample.  The choice of a particular screening threshold is left to the user,
and should be based on careful consideration of application-specific tradeoffs
between sensitivity and specificit
