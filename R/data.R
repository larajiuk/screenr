#' UIV Testing Data on Unicorns
#'
#' A preliminary study was conducted in which a random sample of 5,000 properly
#' consented unicorns were each asked five questions about their behavior and
#' health. They responded by stomping a hoof once to indicate "no", and twice to
#' indicate "yes".  A sample of blood was drawn from each, and was subsequently
#' tested for the presence of antibodies to Unicorn Immunodeficiency Virus (UIV)
#' using a standard assay algorithm.

#' @format A data frame with six columns:
#' \describe{
#' \item{\code{testresult}}{UIV status, where 0 and 1 denote negative and positive test results, repectively.}
#' \item{\code{Q1--Q5}}{Responses (0 = "no", 1 = "yes") to screening questions 1--5.}
